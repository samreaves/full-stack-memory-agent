# Learning AI Agents with Memory in Python

## Objective
1. Set up a basic server using Python, uv, and FastAPI
2. Store sessions in memory first
3. Create an endpoint that receives chat messages, communicates to a model, saves the response, and streams the response back to the client

## Later goals
1. Add Svelte UI for lightweight chat client
2. Embed meanings and store them in vector db. Adjust model prompts with additional context from this db
